Well, despite around 10 years of pure PlayStation fanboyism, I've caved
in and decided to get an XBox 360. With the South African launch
happening officially at midnight on Friday the 29th, I now find myself
counting the hours, and thinking XBox and games every waking moment. I
don't know if it's hype or something, but I can't remember being this
excited about a console before.

I shall be collecting my new toy from Look & Listen, first thing on
Saturday morning, along with an extra wireless controller, Need for
Speed: Most Wanted, Burnout Revenge (all included in a R4399 bundle),
then I'll be dashing off to BT Games to grab Dead Or Alive 4, and
Project Gotham Racing 3 at somewhat lower prices than Look & Listen
offer.

Looking forward to writing about my experiences with the 360, something
different for a change. Only two sleeps left!
