Alrighty, time to release [DynaBar
2](http://shrimpworks.za.net/projects/dynabar/).

I've thrown together a page for it, [check it
out](http://shrimpworks.za.net/projects/dynabar/). Download and a lot
more information on features and plugins are available on the new page.

To see what's new, take a look at the README in the docs/ directory.

Have fun :).
