Well, after mucking around for a couple of days with possible layouts
and trying to decide on Python or PHP, I gave in and took the easy way
out and decided to try some pre-built blogging/CMS software...

I found Geeklog (what you're looking at now). It seems to be a nice
blend of blog and CMS... I think I can get it to do what I want it to
with a minimum amount of effort :P.

Umm anyway, this is going to be my personal site type thing where I put
my stuff and things...
