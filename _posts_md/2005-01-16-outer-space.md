Here's something that's been keeping me quite entertained recently.
Outer Space is an online multiplayer space game where you try to explore
and colonise as many systems as possible while forming alliances with
other players to try to keep alive.

Sounds pretty simple... But throw in a huge tech tree that you can
research to improve your production, research, population, ships, etc,
and things become complicated pretty quickly.

The game is turn based, and each turn lasts an hour, so you need only
check up on your empire once an hour. Or if you build up production,
research and fleet order ques, you can check in even less often if you
like.

Requires [Python](http://python.org/) and [PyGame](http://pygame.org/)
