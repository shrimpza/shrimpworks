Well as expected, my little wxPython dict client is finished.

I decided to install the File Managment plugin to let me put this stuff
on here somehow... So check out pyDict in the "Files" link on the
top-right of the site.

Or simply go here: <http://shrimpworks.za.net/filemgmt/index.php>

The ReadMe explains the basics of how it works and stuff...
