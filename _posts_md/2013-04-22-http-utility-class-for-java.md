Here's a small Java class I've been using in loads of applications and
things for a few years (it's evolved a little over the years).

It simply exposes a few very basic HTTP methods (for HEAD, GET and POST)
which all just return strings containing the web server's response. It's
seemed pretty useful and reliable in applications large and small, so
maybe it's of some use to someone else as well.
