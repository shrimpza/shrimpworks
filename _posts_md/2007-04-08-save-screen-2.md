A long time ago, in a galaxy not far away, I created a very small
application named
[SaveScreen](http://shrimpworks.za.net/2005/10/03/savescreen-save-screenshots-instantly/).
Today I'm rather pleased to release a much-improved [SaveScreen
2](/projects/savescreen/).

A couple of anti-virus applications complained that the .dll file
distributed with SaveScreen which enabled detecting when "Print Screen"
was pressed, was a virus or malware of some sort, so even I was unable
to use SaveScreen, which made my cry.

Finally fed up, I set out to resolve the situation by creating a brand
new application which did not rely on random keyboard hooks and stuff.
The result is SaveScreen 2.

In addition to no longer being flagged as a virus, SaveScreen 2 features
direct ImageShack posting (complete with automatic forum code creation
and thumbnail support), and FTP uploads of screenshots. Something which
may be rather handy (just don't take a screenshot of your bank statement
then complain when the whole world is exposed to it - use with care).
Also, it can save screenshots in per-application folders, making
organisation somewhat neater.
