Well I installed dictd on xan (this server) yesterday, and it seems to
be working great for Nooblet (my IRC bot, powered by Supybot -
<http://sypybot.com/>) since my ADSL is capped. Accessing it over the
LAN and internet works great as well, though I have been hunting for a
decent Windows dict client - they don't seem to exist.

Anyway, so I'm creating a quick little client in Python/wxPython with
the dictclient module (<http://erwin.complete.org/devel>) . Not intended
to be a great big feature packed client, it just needs tolook up words
after all :D

Should be done in a few hours...
