This is a republishing, with some minor tweaks and alternatives
provided, of the original recipe by [Andrew
Muller](http://www.easy-sugar-free-recipes.com/sugar-free-healthy-breakfast-muffins.html).
I could not find some of the ingredients in local shops, so had to
slightly tweak things.

I'd also recommend against using paper muffin cups, as the first two
tray-fulls of these were so stuck to them half the muffin content ends
up going to waste.

The ingredient volumes below make about 20-30 muffins depending on how
big you make them.

**The Recipe**

-   2 eggs
-   1 tsp. vanilla
-   2 cups unsweetened apple sauce
-   1 banana, mashed
-   1/2 cup agave (alternative: \~100ml honey mixed with \~50ml hot
    water to achieve similar consistency)
-   5 cups rolled oats
-   1/4 cup flaxseed meal (alternative: 1/2 cup wholewheat flour)
-   1 tbsp. ground cinnamon
-   3 tsp. baking powder
-   1 tsp. salt
-   2 cups milk (almond milk for dairy free)
-   Optional toppings: raisins, walnuts, almonds, chocolate chips.

**Directions**

1.  Preheat oven to 180 degrees celcius. Mix eggs, vanilla, apple sauce,
    banana & agave.
2.  In a separate bowl, mix oats, flax, cinnamon, baking powder
    and salt. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients.
    Finally, pour in milk and mix.
3.  Spray a muffin pan with baking oil or use muffin liners. Pour batter
    evenly into each liner. If using toppings add them onto tops of
    muffins now.
4.  Bake 35-40 min, test with toothpick if it comes out clean the
    muffins are done. Cool and enjoy, or freeze in freezer bags if you
    plan on storing them more than a few days.
