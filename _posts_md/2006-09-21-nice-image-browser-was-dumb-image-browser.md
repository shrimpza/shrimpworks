After the release of the "[Dumb Image
Browser](http://shrimpworks.za.net/2006/05/28/php-image-browser-and-download-stats/)",
(which worked/works very well for what it's supposed to do), I thought
of prettying it up a bit, and adding some extra features.

The result is the [Nice Image
Browser](http://shrimpworks.za.net/projects/image-browser/). It's vastly
improved in terms of visuals, as well as offering features like easier
browsing around the galleries, easy creation of new galleries, and
uploading files directly from the browser.

It maintains the same PHP5-powered, database-less, cache-less,
auto-thumbnail generating system of the Dumb Image Browser, meaning it's
just as easy to get set up (copy the files to a directory you want to
become your gallery).

Thanks to [Korpse/k4y/K\`](http://kaydash.za.net/) for the new
stylesheet used for displaying the thumbnails.

The ReadMe includes usage and setup instructions. Happy image browsing!
:)
