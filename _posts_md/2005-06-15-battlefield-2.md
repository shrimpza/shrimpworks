MMMMMMMMM

This game (demo at the moment) is really sucking up all my evenings :D.
The gameplay is absolutely brilliant. The whole Squad story is just
ownage when playing with a decent bunch of players. Just a pitty squads
can only be 6 people big.

I can actually fly planes too. Managed to shoot down a helicopter and a
plane last night (though the plane kill took about 5 minutes of frantic
flying from my victom). Though there's always someone else behind me
waiting for me to fly straight for a half second too long :(.

If you like team games, with a rather unrealistic, yet somehow realistic
feel, get this when it comes out on the 28th (South African release
aparrently).
