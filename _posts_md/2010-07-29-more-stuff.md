Got some more goodies fitted to my ricemobile, this time, a rad brake
upgrade!

Previously, I had Powerbrake disks with street pads, and unfortunately
pretty much killed them on the track. I've fitted a brand new set of
[Powerbrake front
disks,](http://www.powerbrake.co.za/prod_kits/kits_gt.htm) as well as
[Endless CC-Rg
pads](http://www.tougedistribution.com/item--Endless-CC-Rg-Winding-and-Circuit-Front-Brake-Pads--EP406-CCRG/)
and replaced the brake fluid with [Endless RF-650 brake
fluid](http://www.tougedistribution.com/item--Endless-RF-650-Brake-Fluid--EF-RF650/).

As the pads are primarily meant for track use, they squeal like hell
under light braking on the street, but that's something I'm happy to
live with, though I'm not sure the neighbours would agree when I come
and go at night. Even though they're not completely bedded in yet, they
stop like nothing on earth.

Cannot wait to try the 'zorst and brakes out at a proper track day next
month (and also see how my ECU tune does)!
