Seems I've spent most of today writing Dosage
(<http://slipgate.za.net/dosage/>) modules - managed to find a whole
load of comics, and ended up making 10 new modules.

It's surprising how many comics have their main images sliced in half
somewhere midway through the image (so it ends up being 2 images which
Dosage obviously won't handle), I found some that even have each panel
in a seperate HTML table cell :-/.

Not sure if it's bad web design or whatever, but it's a pity since
they'll never make their way into Dosage...
