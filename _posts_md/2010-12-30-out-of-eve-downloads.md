This is just a small update on the status of OOE. As the SVN server
previously hosting the OOE source died, and many people have been
looking for the source, a [Google Code project has been
started](http://code.google.com/p/ooe/) to facilitate future
development.

The source is available as both a regular download and via Subversion.

It's unlikely I will be doing any development on the project myself,
however contributors are welcome.
