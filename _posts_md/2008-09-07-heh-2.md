Well, shit happens, and unfortunately OOE 1.1 hasn't as I'd planned. I
HOPE to be able to have this going by next week....

I've wanted something to make browsing through largish JSON objects a
bit easier for work for a long while now, and suddenly got the idea that
01:00 on Saturday morning would be a good time to create such an
application.

The result is the rather simple but effective [JSON
Explorer](http://shrimpworks.za.net/projects/json-explorer/).
