Yes indeed, I am posting a recipe now.

This recipe is a combination of a few, and some customisation.

**Cheese Sauce - Ingredients:**

-   2 Tbsp margarine
-   2.5 Tbsp flour
-   1 cup cream
-   1 cup milk
-   1 cup grated mature cheddar cheese
-   1 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)

**Cheese Sauce - Method:**

1.  Melt the margarine in a saucepan until it starts to bubble gently
2.  Slowly mix in the flour, ensuring it's thoroughly smooth
3.  Very slowly, bit-by-bit, mix in the cream and milk, keeping the
    mixture as smooth as possible
4.  Once all the milk is in, you should now have a smooth creamy
    white sauce. Mix the the cheese and stir until melted
5.  At this point, you may optionally stir in the cayenne pepper, or
    other spices of your preference

The same cheese sauce can be used for making macaroni and cheese :).

**Potato Bake - Ingredients:**

-   5-6 medium-sized potatoes
-   0.5 cup onion, sliced
-   0.5 cup grated cheese
-   Freshly ground salt and pepper

**Potato Bake - Method:**

1.  Pre-heat oven to 180 degrees Celsius
2.  Wash and slice potatoes (peeling optional - I did not peel them)
    into 0.5-1cm thick slices, and cover the bottom of a casserole dish
    with one layer
3.  Place a third of the onion slices on top of the potato slices and
    add salt and pepper
4.  Pour out a third of the cheese sauce over the onions and potato
5.  Repeat layering an additional 2 times, and top with grated cheese
    over the final layer of cheese sauce
6.  Place in the oven and bake for 1 hour

DONE. Now stuff your face!
