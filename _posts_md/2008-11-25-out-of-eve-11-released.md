Hah. Only 3 months late.

Out of Eve has been fully updated to Quantum Rise spec, the promised
journal feeds, API key security, and a number of other tweaks.
[OutofEve.com](http://www.outofeve.com/ "Out of Eve") has been updated
to the latest available version, and the source is [available for
download](http://www.outofeve.com/about/ "Out of Eve about page").

Please leave any feedback in the comments of this post. I'll set up a
proper OOE page on this site at some point, with download links and more
detailed information.
