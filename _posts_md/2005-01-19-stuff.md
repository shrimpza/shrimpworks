Heh, I'm feeling sort of blank lately... :(

Finally my Naruto collection is up-to-date thanks to |sAvAgE|, and he's
filling in the missing parts of the Full Metal Alchemist series too. So
I've started watching FMA from the beginning again.

Something is REALLY wrong with the IS FTP server. I think they must be
doing shaping for non-IS customers propery now :(. Updated a bunch of
xan's (this server) packages last night and it took an age to download
just 27mb.
