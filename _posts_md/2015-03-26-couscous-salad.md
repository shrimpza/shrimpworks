Here's a couscous salad recipe I used recently, made by stealing ideas
from about 3 other recipes and tweaking a bit of customising. Would eat
again :-)

**Ingredients:**

-   1 cup couscous
-   1 cup water
-   200g cherry tomatoes
-   1/2 cup spring onion
-   1/4 red bell pepper
-   1/4 yellow bell pepper
-   1/4 green bell pepper
-   1/2 cup crumbed feta
-   Dressing:
    -   75ml canola or olive oil
    -   25ml lemon juice
    -   freshly ground salt and pepper

**Directions:**

1.  Place couscous in a sealable bowl, boil the water, then add boiling
    water to couscous. Cover and allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Once
    ready, fluff with a fork.
2.  Cut tomatoes in half, finely chop peppers and spring onions, and mix
    into couscous.
3.  Dressing: Thoroughly mix together oil and lemon juice, and mix in
    salt and pepper as required.
4.  Before serving, mix in feta and dressing.
