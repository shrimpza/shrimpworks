Sooo, I received a [query](http://www.akaradio.com/) about wether it
would be possible to have a [DynaBar](/projects/dynabar) plugin show
information from a [ShoutCast](http://www.shoutcast.com/) server.

A bit of investigation on the issue revealed it is indeed quite easy to
[query a ShoutCast
server](http://devshed.excudo.net/scripts/php/explanation/shoutcast+class).
As a result, a new DynaBar popped into existence:

Just dump it into the "plugins" directory, and you're ready to go.
