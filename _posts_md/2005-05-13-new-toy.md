So I went and bought myself a brand spanking new laptop last week :D.

It's an HP Compaq NC8230 featuring the works - Intel Centrino CPU, ATI
X600 'mini' PCI-Express with it's own 64MB RAM (don't you just hate
'shared video RAM?'), 15.4" widescreen display (with ambient light
sensor to adjust brightness dynamically! Ooooooh, aaaah), only a 40GB
HDD still, wifi, bluetooth, smart card reader stuffies, Win XP Pro SP2,
etc etc etc.

All very nice :)

I went and got myself a virus on the day I unpacked it though... So much
for the pre-installed Norton AntiVirus. Dumped Norton and tried out the
home edition of avast! Anti Virus, which saved me rather smartly. Seems
much nicer than the good old AVG system.

Anyway, it's not as pretty as my old one (nx9010), but after a week
using it at work, it actually feels more comfortable despite it's more
rigid, rectangular appearance.

Overall I'm very impressed :-).
