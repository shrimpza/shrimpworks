title: Squid
---

I thought that it's about time I messed around with proxies, so
yeasterday I set up Squid on my server, xan.

The configuration looked like a bit of a mission for a first-timer such
as myself :P, so I whipped out Webmin and slapped on the Squid module.
I'll take a look at the config options it generated some other time and
do it by hand in future.

I must say the variety of options available is quite impressive. The
access control lists are particularly exciting too, there's a helluva
lot that can be done with this stuff.

It's only being used for HTTP at the moment, and is doing an excellent
job. I've managed to get AWStats to do some basic reporting for it, so I
can see who's using how much bandwidth, viewing how many pages, what
file types are being accessed, etc. I'm a bit of a stats junkie :P.

Overall I'm pretty impressed...
