Things have been very quiet on the code front lately, with bursts of
activity here and there.

Primarily, I've been hacking on Out of Eve. The structure API classes
and implementation of the API requests has been bugging me, especially
when I've had to add a lot of stuff in recent versions, it just grows
and grows and becomes unmanageable. Unfortunately fixing it has
obviously resulted in breaking every single piece of the application,
which I've been slowly refactoring and putting back together slightly
more sensibly.

On the other hand it's also a good opportunity to make allowance for the
new customisable API key features CCP are implementing.

Besides that, my totally rad completely unique super secret Java-powered
website project is stalled. Java's turned out to be a bit of a pain in
the backside. Sure all the background code is nice and stuff, but
actually making the *website* portion of stuff quite sucks. I suspect
this project will also need a near complete refactor at some point...
Sigh. Coming soon in 2019!
