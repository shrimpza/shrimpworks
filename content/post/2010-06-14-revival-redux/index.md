Soooo, almost another 2 years since last posting. Lol. That's way worse
than [mithrandi](http://mithrandi.net/blog/) used to be.

Anyway, I spend more time mucking around with my car these days and
attending various events and track days than doing anything this blog
has usually been about :). I thought I might as well start posting about
how that stuff is going to fill some space and perhaps inspire me to
write more stuff here, if only for myself.

To start with, here's a gallery of images from a Honda Racing Club
breakfast run, held in March. All manner of Honda vehicles were in
attendance, our convoy from Northgate to [Auto Cradle
Estate](http://www.autocradleestate.co.za/) was around 70 vehicles long,
comprised of Civics, Accords, Ballades, S2000s, Type Rs, Jazzes, even
the odd Integra. Fun was had by all :)
