\*sigh\*

Seems I've been called off to head office again at literally a day's
notice. I was heading up next weekend though for a LAN with the Avatars
(the UT clan I'm in), so I guess it isn't all bad. Only problem now is
carting around my PC, a new LCD monitor which I'll pick up while I'm
there, 2 weeks worth of clothing, and my laptop. Going to have to
courier the PC up and have someone courier it and the monitor back after
the LAN :(.

Internet is also blocked during office hours in head office, so I'm
basically stuffed as I can't exactly go home and see to things in the
evenings. Where I'm responsible for a bunch of projects, websites, etc
online, this isn't exactly helpful at all. Hopefully I can still SSH
home every now and then... Can't even use VNC since my PC's going to be
all over the country.

Should be back by Monday the 28th... They don't even know where I'm
going to be staying while I'm up there.

\*sigh\* I hate this :(.
