Well I got the E-Check list problems sorted... Was reusing odd variables
:-/

Improved preview functionality in the core and GUI, and added a message
source viewer. Also populated the list of accounts properly with a
wxCheckListBox that lets you select the accounts to check. All working
nicely.

Someone told me I don't talk enough in IRC... :P
