Hopefully I will be getting my car back this afternoon. It's been at
[Dutch Auto](http://www.dutchauto.co.za/) this week where they have been
building and installing one of these:

It's a Toda Racing 4-2-1 Exhaust Manifold :-). I mention they're
building one, because to actually import one of these can cost in excess
of R15 000, so they have created their own version, based on this Toda.
They've also developed their own exhaust system for the Type R which
they're installing to replace my apparently awful sounding RGMotorsport
system :D.

Average gains on other Type Rs have been around 15% kW a the wheels,
although apparently I can't expect much torque as I'm already making
about 210Nm on their dyno. Will have to wait for the final results later
today.

Also, after about 6 months of dragging my heels on the issue, I've
finally got my [Hondata FlashPro](http://www.hondata.com/flashpro.html)
unit. This will help tune the ECU to make maximum use of the exhaust,
and with sufficient tuning, should result in a significant improvement
to mid-range power.

Also, WordPress is upgraded to version 3 :-P
