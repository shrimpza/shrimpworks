Attended a dyno day at [WRC Tuning](http://www.wrctuning.co.za/) on the
5th. Was the first opportunity I've had to compare my car to other FN2s
at the same time under the same conditions, and I'm rather impressed :)

Stock cars made between 116 and 117 kw on the wheels, and my car pulled
off a very respectable 131 kw. Not bad for a naturally aspirated 2l
motor in oxygen-starved Jo'burg :D.
