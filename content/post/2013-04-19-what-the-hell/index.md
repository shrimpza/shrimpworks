Going on two years since I updated this thing?

I'm trying to revive this now, and hopefully turn it into a proper
central resource for "me" stuff. I've already updated the projects with
some of my bigger/older things, which never made it on here for some
reason, including [Monster
Hunt](http://shrimpworks.za.net/projects/monster-hunt/ "Monster Hunt")
and [UnWheel](http://shrimpworks.za.net/projects/unwheel/ "UnWheel").

Trying to get the "gallery" pimped out a bit as well, with some
additional things and events I've been snapping occasionally.

Not really happy with this design, it seems a bit too informal for what
I want, though the previous design I have used for the past few (8+?)
years has got a bit stale.

More stuff to follow shortly.
