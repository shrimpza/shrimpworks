title: Gran Turismo 4 photo fun
---

I sat down this afternoon and had a bit of a play with Gran Turismo 4's
Photo Tour option within GT mode. I must admit I'm rather impressed, and
although it's seemingly boring, it turned out to be a rather
entertaining exersize.

It basically presents you with a couple of venues from around the world
- Venice, Tokyo, New York, the Grand Canyon, etc, which are pretty much
static scenes, with pre-defined car and camera 'zones' within which you
may arrange things to you liking. You control the vehicle location,
rotation and wheel rotation, and camera location, height, tilt, zoom,
focus, etc. After you've got your scene arranged just right, you can
fiddle with things like colour balance, saturation, etc to get the scene
just right.

You then get to take your photo in a lovely high resolution, and save it
to a USB flash disk! WOW! Someone finally found something useful to do
with the PlayStation 2's USB ports, aside from whacky controller
contraptions. Anyway, once saved, you pop off to your nearest PC and
offload your pics (which are saved in JPG format).

A few of my results (I only have cheap cars in my garage at the
moment);
