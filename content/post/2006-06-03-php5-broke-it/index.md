title: PHP5 broke it
---

Seems just about everything on my server machine has been running
perfectly since I upgraded to PHP5, except this site :(.

So for the time being, the attachments plugin is disabled (the cause of
the problem), so no downloads are available until I fixxor it.

***Edit:** Well, that took all of 5 minutes to fix ;)*
