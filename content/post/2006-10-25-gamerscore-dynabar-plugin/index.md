title: GamerScore DynaBar plugin
---

Since the XBox Live "GamerCards" are so [nicely
exposed](http://gamercard.xbox.com/ShrimpyZA.card), there's really no
reason not to have a
[DynaBar](http://shrimpworks.za.net/projects/dynabar/) plugin for it,
now is there.

I've noticed a few GamerCards claiming to be in "userbar" format,
however they do not follow userbar standards in layout, dimensions, or
fonts. So, soon you too can have a lovely dynamic standards-compliant
GamerScore userbar such as this:
