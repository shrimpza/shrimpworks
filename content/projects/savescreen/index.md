SaveScreen is a small Windows utility which automatically save
screenshots as JPEG images. This is especially useful for gamers, as
all screenshots can be stored in one place, there's no need to use
additional applications to re-save images as JPEGs (suitable for use
on forums, galleries, etc), and you don't need to bind different sets
of keys for every game you play, "Print screen" is all you need.

Features
--------

-   Select JPEG compression/quality to suit your needs.
-   **New!** Each screenshot can be saved in its own folder, named
    after the application it's taken from.
-   **New!** Images can be uploaded to an FTP server for web publication
    and sharing, also supporting per-application sub-folders.
-   **New!** Images can be posted directly to
    [ImageShack](http://www.imageshack.us/), for even easier sharing,
    includes support for thumbnails and automatic forum and HTML code
    generation for quick posting.

### Update 14 April 2013

Rather than using the ImageShack or FTP support, set SaveScreen to save
your images in a public DropBox folder for convenient storage and
immediate publishing!
