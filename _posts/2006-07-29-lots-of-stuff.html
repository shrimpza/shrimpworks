<p>Hmmmmm, long time no update. That's not to say I haven't been busy recently.</p>
<p>Last month, we released "<a href="http://unwheel.beyondunreal.com/">UnWheel R5</a>", which seems to have become the (hopefully) final release. I'm pretty happy with it at the moment, all the major bugs are gone, multiplayer is working wonderfully and the online record system is churning records around at a mean rate (and those records still need a monthly rotation system applied, so still some work to be done there). I still haven't decided if I want to do this all again in Unreal Torunament 2007 or not :).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I've been playing around with <a href="http://shrimpworks.za.net/2005/12/18/dynabar-dynamic-userbars/">DynaBar</a>, and it's grown a <strong>lot</strong>. The plugin system has been tweaked to allow better customisation options from the developer side, as well as having options added to improve the user interaction side of things. There are a whole crapload of other options available as well, multiple layers (supporting PNG graphics with alpha transparency), different scanline styles, text prefixes and suffixes, better caching options, etc. In addition, you can choose to have the bakcground be a gradient blending between any two colours, horizontal or vertical, and you can create "groups", which is a bunch of userbars animated (with fading/blending between bars), and they all remain fully dynamic. Speaking of dynamic, I've also added a whole load of plugins, from XFire, to more Last.FM options, to Battlefield 2 and TrackMania, and even RSS headlines and live game server status via Qstat.</p>
<p><a href="http://dynabar.shrimpworks.za.net/designer/">I've put up a test system here</a> as a sort of sandbox, so feel free to try out all the options and plugins, and if you have any suggestions or ideas for plugins, please let me know. In addition to the designer, <a href="http://dynabar.shrimpworks.za.net/designer/browse.php">there's a browser available</a>, which lets you easily build the animated groups mentioned above. Also, it all works with Internet Explorer now, which I didn't bother fixing with the previous version (wasn't meant to be such a "big" project :)). Source code package will be available as soon as some more testing is done.</p>
<p>In addition, I've been re-writing my online <a href="http://slipgate.za.net/dosage/">Dosage</a>-powered comic viewer - Injector - <strong>again</strong>, this time it's going fully "Web 2.0" (ZOMG!), so everything's quite nice and quick. This project still needs a bit of work on the administration and installation side of things before it can see a release.</p>
<p>Aside from all that, I've also been slowly building a new UnrealZA site, using the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Python-powered Django framework</a>. It really is a wonderful thing. Please excuse me for a minute while I run away from a horde of crazy, twisted, Nevow fans (among others). Anyway, I'll happily recomment Django any day of the week to anyone looking for a Python web framework.</p>
<p>I've also decided I don't like the look of this site anymore, so I guess that's another thing to go on my to-do list for the near future.</p>
