Sup.

Since there are [certain people](http://blog.mbvdl.net/) about how
hosting a website on unreliable home ADSL is a generally bad idea, I've
decided to move it to a more stable, permanent home on my little
[Linode](http://linode.com/).

Also, since my last post, a number of things have happened in my life in
general. Firstly, I bought a really leet car. A brand spanking new
[Honda Civic hatch](http://xan.shrimpworks.za.net/pics/?./car). It's
probably the single most awesome thing I've ever owned, and I love it to
death :D.

Shortly after that, mother and I decided to club in together and buy a
town house. We've only ever rented places before, so the whole buying
thing was a bit new, but it pretty much sorts itself out after 3459094
different companies and institutions shove 459345 different documents in
front of you to sign.

The place is in a nice small complex in a quiet corner of Ruimsig, on
the very western edges of Roodepoort. Very nice little house, nice big
garden (sometimes it's very relaxing to feel real grass under bare feet
:)).

Anyway, work's been keeping me pretty busy, so I haven't had a lot of
quality time with either of the above new things... Really need to take
some leave I think...
