<p>All of my Debian desktop installs running KDE received an update a month or two ago which rendered the "Apper" package management application broken, failing with the following error:</p>
<pre>Unable to open database read-only: Database action 'prepare dependency insert 
statement' failed: table dependencies has no column named items_installed</pre>
<p>The solution is to delete the Listaller cache DB: </p>
<pre>rm -r /var/lib/listaller/db/</pre>
<p>The cache will be recreated automatically with the expected structure on the next run of Apper (or other PackageKit type thing).</p>
