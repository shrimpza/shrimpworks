<p>My idea for implimenting non-physics physics into my little game framework didn't work out too well, so I gave in and took a look around for options.</p>
<p>It seems only ODE is available to Python, via <a href="http://pyode.sf.net/">PyODE</a>. Not many [open source] physics engines seem to have Python bindings, which I find rather odd.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it isn't actually all that of a mission to get ODE and Ogre working together, and the results I've got so far are quite acceptable. I can spawn loads of cubes (of varying sizes) and throw them around the scene and they bounce and jump around in a suitable fasion.</p>

<p>I haven't tried with balls or polygon-accurate stuff yet, that's next on the to-do list. I also intend writing a short how-to for PyODE and PyOgre integration at some point, as I was a little confused to start with, not knowing quite where or how to begin, and there is no PyODE/PyOgre example code floating around to reference.</p>
<p><i>EDIT: Example using PyODE and PyOgre now available - http://shrimpworks.za.net/2006/03/21/pyode-physics-in-pyogre-example/</i></p>
