The [Honda Owner's Club of South Africa](http://www.hondaowners.co.za/)
hosted a Bridgestone-sponsored track day at Zwartkops this last Sunday.
Was seriously awesome to be able to zoot around with similar performance
cars, unlike a regular track day where you have to constantly worry
about being run off the road by BMW M3s :D.

A highlight was a pair of Integras out on the track, although I'm proud
to say my 'lil Type R was quite capable of outperforming them all day
:P.

Grabbed a bunch of shots of the action.
