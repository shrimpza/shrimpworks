<p>(Wanted to reply to <a href="http://programming.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/11/23/1914216&from=rss">this NewsForge article</a>, since some other seemingly know-it-all n00bs were ranting in the comments about Smarty being a waste of time, however their comments system won't let me post [most likely a problem on SAIX's side])</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>After having used Smarty for around 2 years now, I don't think I could ever go back to writing PHP applications without it.</p>
<p>It's brilliant to be able to spend some time working out your code, logic, etc all nicely in a PHP script, assigning the variables and values you want to present on the final page, then go and throw together a plain HTML page with some smarty tags to display that information.</p>
<p>Bug in your HTML? No need to dig through PHP scripts bloated with loads of HTML searching for problems, just whip out the template and correct it easily. Same goes for debugging the PHP code, it's not all mixed in with the HTML so it's millions of time easier to debug.</p>
<p>Overall, there's no faster, cleaner way of writing PHP applications.</p>
