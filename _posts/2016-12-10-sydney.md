I recently spent some time in Australia, specifically Sydney and Melbourne, and took a bunch of photos from a few parks and interesting places in Sydney (unfortunately I was pretty ill and didn't get out very far in Melbourne).

I really enjoyed the number of parks and amount of greenery around the city centres.

[All the Sydney images are up here](/gallery/2016-10-sydney/).
