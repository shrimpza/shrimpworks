<p>I've had a couple of questions regarding my <a href="http://shrimpworks.za.net/2005/09/12/battlefield-2-stats-in-python/">Battlefile 2 Stats in Python</a> post, and how it may be possible to do the same in PHP, so I thought I'd add an update for that.</p>
<p>Simple PHP code for Battlefield 2 Stats retrieval:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-php">    ini_set("user_agent","GameSpyHTTP/1.0");

    $info = "per*,cmb*,twsc,cpcp,cacp,dfcp,kila,heal,rviv,rsup,rpar,tgte,dkas,dsab,cdsc,rank,cmsc,kick,kill,deth,suic,ospm,klpm,klpr,dtpr,bksk,wdsk,bbrs,tcdr,ban,dtpm,lbtl,osaa,vrk,tsql,tsqm,tlwf,mvks,vmks,mvn*,vmr*,fkit,fmap,fveh,fwea,wtm-,wkl-,wdt-,wac-,wkd-,vtm-,vkl-,vdt-,vkd-,vkr-,atm-,awn-,alo-,abr-,ktm-,kkl-,kdt-,kkd-";

    $pid = '43595724';
    $data = file("http://bf2web.gamespy.com/ASP/getplayerinfo.aspx?pid=".$pid."&info=".$info);

    $stats = array_combine(explode("\t", $data[3]), explode("\t", $data[4]));

    printf("%s has %s kills and %s deaths and a score of %s", $stats['nick'], $stats['kill'], $stats['deth'], $stats['scor']);
</code></pre>
<p>Note that if you're not using PHP5, you'll need to add the following drop-in replacement for the "array_combine" function:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-php">    function array_combine($keys, $vals) {
        $i = 0;
        foreach ($keys as $key) {
            $newarray[trim($key)] = trim($vals[$i++]);
        }
        return $newarray;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>It's also important to note that while at the time of writing this, this method of retrieving stats works, EA, DICE and GameSpy are supposedly working on a new XML-based stats system for BF2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Updated:</strong> Since this was written, some things changed with the stats system, and the GameSpy application requires you to pass a bunch of columns you want info for. This can help customise the data you get back, so you only request what you need. I've included all the columns in the <strong>$info</strong> variable, which you can customise. Make sure it contains only valid columns, or you won't get any data back at all.</p>
<p>For info on what to do with the stats, and what all the columns etc. mean, check out the <a href="http://bf2.fun-o-matic.org/index.php/BF2Stats">BF2 Technical Wiki</a>.</em></p>
