<p>Going on two years since I updated this thing?</p>
<p>I'm trying to revive this now, and hopefully turn it into a proper central resource for "me" stuff. I've already updated the projects with some of my bigger/older things, which never made it on here for some reason, including <a href="http://shrimpworks.za.net/projects/monster-hunt/" title="Monster Hunt">Monster Hunt</a> and <a href="http://shrimpworks.za.net/projects/unwheel/" title="UnWheel">UnWheel</a>.</p>
<p>Trying to get the "gallery" pimped out a bit as well, with some additional things and events I've been snapping occasionally.</p>
<p>Not really happy with this design, it seems a bit too informal for what I want, though the previous design I have used for the past few (8+?) years has got a bit stale.</p>
<p>More stuff to follow shortly.</p>
