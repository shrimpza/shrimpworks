<p>Someone posted an image of somewhere they're staying in "Qatar Doha" (no, I don't know exactly where that is ;)) on the <a href="http://games.saix.net/cgi-bin/sgsbb/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=240;t=32229">SGS Forums</a>, mentioning how similar it looks to the Battlefield 2 map, Strike at Karkand.</p>
<p>I thought it might be cool to try to make the image look a bit more like the map, adjusting the colour balance, adding the orangey dusty air effect, etc. Further on, someone posted an image with some player characters and a jet overlayed, I though it was a pretty cool idea, so I whipped out Photoshop, my previously modified image, the <a href="http://www.battlefield2.com/">official BF2 site</a> (for screenshots of vehicles and characters), and got to work.</p>
<p>The end result is pretty cool I think :D. Click for full versions  (original on the left, mine on the right):</p>

<p>Update; toned down the colours a bit, didn't realise the monitor I did this on originally was so off :P.</p>
