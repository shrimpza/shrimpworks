<p>Well, shit happens, and unfortunately OOE 1.1 hasn't as I'd planned. I HOPE to be able to have this going by next week....</p>
<p>I've wanted something to make browsing through largish JSON objects a bit easier for work for a long while now, and suddenly got the idea that 01:00 on Saturday morning would be a good time to create such an application.</p>
