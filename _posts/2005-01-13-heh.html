<p>Well I got the E-Check list problems sorted... Was reusing odd variables :-/</p>
<p>Improved preview functionality in the core and GUI, and added a message source viewer. Also populated the list of accounts properly with a wxCheckListBox that lets you select the accounts to check. All working nicely.</p>
<p>Someone told me I don't talk enough in IRC... :P</p>
