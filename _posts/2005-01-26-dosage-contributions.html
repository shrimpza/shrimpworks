<p>Seems I've spent most of today writing Dosage (<a href="http://slipgate.za.net/dosage/">http://slipgate.za.net/dosage/</a>) modules - managed to find a whole load of comics, and ended up making 10 new modules.</p>
<p>It's surprising how many comics have their main images sliced in half somewhere midway through the image (so it ends up being 2 images which Dosage obviously won't handle), I found some that even have each panel in a seperate HTML table cell :-/.</p>
<p>Not sure if it's bad web design or whatever, but it's a pity since they'll never make their way into Dosage...</p>
