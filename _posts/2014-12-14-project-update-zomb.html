<p>As mentioned, <a href="http://shrimpworks.za.net/2014/12/01/a-new-old-thing/" title="A New (Old) Thing">I've resurrected an old idea</a>, and began work on it as a bit of a learning/practice exercise. I think it's working out rather well.</p>
<p>The primary application itself, <a href="https://github.com/shrimpza/zomb">hosted on GitHub here</a>,  is essentially complete, barring the ability to persist your plugin configuration (pfft, who needs to store things anyway).</p>
<p>Some stuff learned along the way:</p>
<p><b>API-driven development:</b><br />
Designing the external-facing API (actually defining and completely documenting the exact request and response data structures, not just "there will be a request that does things and a response that looks something like X") was a huge help. Defining the API allows you to see how the system will actually be used up-front before writing a single line of code, and allows you to easily spot gaps and shortcomings. Once done, the "user documentation" becomes the same documentation I used to implement the back-end, which made it incredibly easy.</p>
<p><b>Git:</b><br />
Still learning, getting more comfortable with it. IntelliJ IDEA has excellent built-in Git support out-the-box, and although painful to use in a Windows shell (it's basically Bash, inside cmd.exe), I'm getting more used to the Git CLI.</p>
<p><b>Free/online continuous integration:</b><br />
Initially, I started off using <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a>. This requires you to store a ".travis.yml" file within the root of your Git repository which I was rather uncomfortable with (I don't like "external" metadata type things hanging around in my source repository). As an alternative, I've switched to using <a href="https://drone.io/github.com/shrimpza/zomb">Drone.io</a>, which just "feels" like a nicer solution. It also has additional features like the ability to store artefacts for download, or publish your artefacts to external services or servers - so you could have successful builds automatically deploy the latest binaries.</p>
<p><b>Persistence/Storage:</b><br />
Persistence is hard, so once you start a service up, it should run indefinitely so you never need to write anything to disk. Sigh. Also, this part was not designed at all up-front, and my flailing around trying to get a workable solution is evidence of the need for proper design and planning before jumping in with code.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there are additional projects which were spawned:</p>
<p><b><a href="https://github.com/shrimpza/zomb-web">zomb-web</a></b><br />
The first front-end for ZOMB. A simple single-page HTML UI. Had some good practice remembering how to HTML and Javascript here...</p>
<p><b><a href="https://github.com/shrimpza/zomb-plugins">zomb-plugins</a></b><br />
A growing collection of plugins for ZOMB. At present, they're all PHP (again, refreshing old skills...) and pretty simple. Currently, there's <em>time</em> (simple current time/time-zone conversion), <em>lastfm</em> (see what someone's currently listening to, find similar artists), <em>weather</em> (current and forecast conditions for a given city) and <em>currency</em> (simple currency conversion).</p>
<p>None of the above cannot be achieved without a simple web search, so next up I'd like to create a CLI client - weather updates in your terminal!</p>
