<p>Well as expected, my little wxPython dict client is finished.</p>
<p>I decided to install the File Managment plugin to let me put this stuff on here somehow... So check out pyDict in the "Files" link on the top-right of the site.</p>
<p>Or simply go here: <a href="http://shrimpworks.za.net/filemgmt/index.php">http://shrimpworks.za.net/filemgmt/index.php</a></p>
<p>The ReadMe explains the basics of how it works and stuff...</p>
