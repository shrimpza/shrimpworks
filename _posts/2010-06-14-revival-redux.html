<p>Soooo, almost another 2 years since last posting. Lol. That's way worse than <a href="http://mithrandi.net/blog/">mithrandi</a> used to be.</p>
<p>Anyway, I spend more time mucking around with my car these days and attending various events and track days than doing anything this blog has usually been about :). I thought I might as well start posting about how that stuff is going to fill some space and perhaps inspire me to write more stuff here, if only for myself.</p>
<p>To start with, here's a gallery of images from a Honda Racing Club breakfast run, held in March. All manner of Honda vehicles were in attendance, our convoy from Northgate to <a href="http://www.autocradleestate.co.za/">Auto Cradle Estate</a> was around 70 vehicles long, comprised of Civics, Accords, Ballades, S2000s, Type Rs, Jazzes, even the odd Integra. Fun was had by all :)</p>
