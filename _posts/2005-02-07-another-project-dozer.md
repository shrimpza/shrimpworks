\*sigh\* Look at me starting a million projects and never finishing any
of them :P.

Well this one, I fully intend finishing at least. It's a wxPython GUI
front-end for Dosage (http://slipgate.za.net/dosage/) which basically
has the sole goal of making managing your comics easier for the mouse
potatoes out there (and makes Dosage more accessable to the average Joe
user who doesn't want to mess around with command lines and stuff).

At present, it doesn't do much, it simply builds a nice tree of comic
modules (virtual modules are displayed as branches) and allows you to
add those to a list (which basically makes up your 'subscriptions'), and
lets you select one or more of those and have Dosage download the latest
strip for them.
