<p>Hah. Only 3 months late.</p>
<p>Out of Eve has been fully updated to Quantum Rise spec, the promised journal feeds, API key security, and a number of other tweaks. <a title="Out of Eve" href="http://www.outofeve.com/">OutofEve.com</a> has been updated to the latest available version, and the source is <a title="Out of Eve about page" href="http://www.outofeve.com/about/">available for download</a>.</p>
<p>Please leave any feedback in the comments of this post. I'll set up a proper OOE page on this site at some point, with download links and more detailed information.</p>
