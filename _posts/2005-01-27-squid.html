<p>I thought that it's about time I messed around with proxies, so yeasterday I set up Squid on my server, xan.</p>
<p>The configuration looked like a bit of a mission for a first-timer such as myself :P, so I whipped out Webmin and slapped on the Squid module. I'll take a look at the config options it generated some other time and do it by hand in future.</p>
<p>I must say the veriety of options available is quite impressive. The access control lists are particularly exciting too, there's a helluva lot that can be done with this stuff.</p>
<p>It's only being used for HTTP at the moment, and is doing an excellent job. I've managed to get AWStats to do some basic reporting for it, so I can see who's using how much bandwidth, viewing how many pages, what file types are being accessed, etc. I'm a bit of a stats junkie :P.</p>
<p>Overall I'm pretty impressed...</p>
