<p>Seems just about everything on my server machine has been running perfectly since I upgraded to PHP5, except this site :(.</p>
<p>So for the time being, the attachments plugin is disabled (the cause of the problem), so no downloads are available until I fixxor it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong><br />
  Well, that took all of 5 minutes to fix ;)</p>
