<p>So <a href="http://kaydash.za.net/">Korpse</a> pointed out a rather interesting website the other night - <a href="http://www.pandora.com.">Pandora</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, it's a rather nice little service which allows you to discover new music, artists, etc, by telling it which music you like already. Based on a song, or artist name you provide, it goes off and finds music matching an assortment of criteria matching the provided song/artist. It then proceeds to play a endless playlist. It's all streaming, but it's extremely good quality for streamed content, and practically never stutters, even when downloading or uploading other stuff  (0n 512k ADSL anyway).</p>
<p>During your listening, if it plays something you don't particularly like, you can tell it so, and it'll further fine tune the playlist, the same applies to something you do like.</p>
<p>I do have a few things I'd like to see added or changed though. The ability to play your well refined playlist in the player of your choice - could play pretty much like a normal streaming playlist. Show a timer/track progress bar thing, it's just nice to know :). Ability to go back and play previously listened to tracks. Perhaps two additional rating categories - it'd be nice to rate vocals and music seperately.</p>
<p>Anyway, my 10 free trial hours are up, and I can't seem to cheat by deleting cookies or something. My MasterCard should be arriving this week some time, and I'm seriously considering that $36 for an annual subscription...</p>
