<p>Well, after mucking around for a couple of days with possible layouts and trying to decide on Python or PHP, I gave in and took the easy way out and decided to try some pre-built blogging/CMS software...</p>
<p>I found Geeklog (what you're looking at now). It seems to be a nice blend of blog and CMS... I think I can get it to do what I want it to with a minimum amount of effort :P.</p>
<p>Umm anyway, this is going to be my personal site type thing where Iput my stuff and things...</p>
