(Wanted to reply to [this NewsForge
article](http://programming.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/11/23/1914216&from=rss),
since some other seemingly know-it-all n00bs were ranting in the
comments about Smarty being a waste of time, however their comments
system won't let me post [most likely a problem on SAIX's side])

After having used Smarty for around 2 years now, I don't think I could
ever go back to writing PHP applications without it.

It's brilliant to be able to spend some time working out your code,
logic, etc all nicely in a PHP script, assigning the variables and
values you want to present on the final page, then go and throw together
a plain HTML page with some smarty tags to display that information.

Bug in your HTML? No need to dig through PHP scripts bloated with loads
of HTML searching for problems, just whip out the template and correct
it easily. Same goes for debugging the PHP code, it's not all mixed in
with the HTML so it's millions of time easier to debug.

Overall, there's no faster, cleaner way of writing PHP applications.
