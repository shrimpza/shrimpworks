Someone posted an image of somewhere they're staying in "Qatar Doha"
(no, I don't know exactly where that is ;)) on the [SGS
Forums](http://games.saix.net/cgi-bin/sgsbb/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=240;t=32229),
mentioning how similar it looks to the Battlefield 2 map, Strike at
Karkand.

I thought it might be cool to try to make the image look a bit more like
the map, adjusting the colour balance, adding the orangey dusty air
effect, etc. Further on, someone posted an image with some player
characters and a jet overlayed, I though it was a pretty cool idea, so I
whipped out Photoshop, my previously modified image, the [official BF2
site](http://www.battlefield2.com/) (for screenshots of vehicles and
characters), and got to work.

The end result is pretty cool I think :D. Click for full versions

Update; toned down the colours a bit, didn't realise the monitor I did
this on originally was so off :P.
