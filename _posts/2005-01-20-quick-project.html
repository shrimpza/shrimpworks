<p>Well I installed dictd on xan (this server) yesterday, and it seems to be working great for Nooblet (my IRC bot, powered by Supybot - <a href="http://sypybot.com/">http://sypybot.com/</a>) since my ADSL is capped. Accessing it over the LAN and internet works great as well, though I have been hunting for a decent Windows dict client - they don't seem to exist.</p>
<p>Anyway, so I'm creating a quick little client in Python/wxPython with the dictclient module (<a href="http://erwin.complete.org/devel">http://erwin.complete.org/devel</a>) . Not intended to be a great big feature packed client, it just needs tolook up words after all :D</p>
<p>Should be done in a few hours...</p>
