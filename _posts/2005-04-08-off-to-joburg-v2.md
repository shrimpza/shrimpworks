Well because I'm aparrently not doing any work here... I'm being trekked
off to JHB yet again. No idea when I'm even getting back. Lovely 3 days
notice I'm given too.

Seems whenever things in my life start settling down and I actually
start getting things done, this shit pops up...

Hrm, I just remembered I was supposed to do some work for an old client
this weekend too... LOLOLOL...... :-(
