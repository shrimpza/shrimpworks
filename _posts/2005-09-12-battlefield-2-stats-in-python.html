<p>Yes, so everyone's obsessed with checking their BF2 stats these days ;).</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to give my <a href="http://www.supybot.net">Supybot</a> IRC bot ("Nooblet" on Shadowfire) the ability to check my own and other people's stats whenever they felt like it. I came up with something like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-python">import urllib2
from string import split
from time import time

# the columns you want to request data for. comma-seperated string.
info = 'per*,cmb*,twsc,cpcp,cacp,dfcp,kila,heal,rviv,rsup,rpar,tgte,dkas,dsab,cdsc,rank,cmsc,kick,kill,deth,suic,ospm,klpm,klpr,dtpr,bksk,wdsk,bbrs,tcdr,ban,dtpm,lbtl,osaa,vrk,tsql,tsqm,tlwf,mvks,vmks,mvn*,vmr*,fkit,fmap,fveh,fwea,wtm-,wkl-,wdt-,wac-,wkd-,vtm-,vkl-,vdt-,vkd-,vkr-,atm-,awn-,alo-,abr-,ktm-,kkl-,kdt-,kkd-'

# this is my BF2 ID. You can also query the stats server with "nick" rather than "pid", but I've had problems with some characters
pid = '43595724'

opener = urllib2.build_opener()
opener.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'GameSpyHTTP/1.0')]  # otherwise GameSpy's servers will block your request
webData = opener.open('http://bf2web.gamespy.com/ASP/getplayerinfo.aspx?pid=%s&info=%s&nocache=%s'%(pid,info,round(time()))).read()

statsData = split(webData, "\n")

cols = split(statsData[3], "\t")
data = split(statsData[4], "\t")

stats = dict(zip(cols, data))

# you now have a nice dictionary with a few hundred bits of stats data.
print "%s has %s kills and %s deaths and a score of %s" % (stats['nick'],stats['kill'],stats['deth'],stats['scor'])</code></pre>
<p>Thanks to korpse and mithrandi for showing me the "zip" funtion. It takes the list from the first parameter, and uses those values as keys in a dictionary, the values from the second parameter are then used as values in that dictionary. I was using map(None, keyList, valueList), but zip seems cleaner.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're looking for more info on stats querying, try the <a href="http://bf2.fun-o-matic.org/index.php?title=BF2_Statistics">BF2 Technical Info wiki</a>, or check out <a href="http://www.totalbf2.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17936">SaladFork's Guide to Creating a BF2  Stat Signature</a> - although it's in PHP, he does give a nice <a href="http://www.totalbf2.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17936#3.3">list of column names</a> and their meanings, you can also grab lists of ranks, weapons, vehicles, etc.</p>
<p><i><b>Update:</b> Also see: <a href="http://shrimpworks.za.net/2005/10/17/battlefield-2-stats-in-php/">Battlefield Stats in PHP</a></i></p>
<p><em><strong>Updated:</strong> Since this was written, some things changed with the stats system, and the GameSpy application requires you to pass a bunch of columns you want info for. This can help customise the data you get back, so you only request what you need. I've included all the columns in the <strong>info</strong> variable, which you can customise. Make sure it contains only valid columns, or you won't get any data back at all.</p>
<p>As above, for info on what all the columns etc. mean, check out the <a href="http://bf2.fun-o-matic.org/index.php/BF2Stats">BF2 Technical Wiki</a>.</em></p>
