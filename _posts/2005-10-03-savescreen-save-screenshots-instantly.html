<p>Ever since installing BattleField 2, I've had a problem with taking screenshots. Basically, the game completely freezes up when I press whatever key is assigned to screen captures, and I need to reset my computer completely. Also, I seemed unable to use Fraps to make screen captures since the game seemed to be blocking all requests to whichever keys I assigned to Fraps' captureing options.</p>
<p>I decided to rather just create my own utility. A simple application that hooks into the "Print Screen" key's press, so when you press Print Screen, this app takes the image out of the clipboard, and will write it to a folder as a JPEG image. You can customise both the output location and the JPEG compression quality. The images are named after the current date and time.</p>
<p>It doesn't work only for games, ANY time you press Print Screen, a screenshot will be saved. I think that could actually be pretty useful.</p>
<p>Yes, there are a million screen grabbers for Windows out there, but writing something yourself is both educational, and you know exactly what it's doing. Also, I now have a single screenshot button for games, and everything else as well :D.</p>
<p>Note this may not work for all games, as some games tend to dump quite a mess to the clipboard when attempting a Print Screen.</p>
<p>This post also serves as a test for the <a href="http://gordon.knoppe.net/articles/category/attach-files/">attachment plugin</a> for WordPress I recently installed ;).</p>
