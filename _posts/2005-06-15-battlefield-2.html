<p>MMMMMMMMM</p>
<p>This game (demo at the moment) is really sucking up all my evenings :D. The gameplay is absolutely brilliant. The whole Squad story is just ownage when playing with a decent bunch of players. Just a pitty squads can only be 6 people big.</p>
<p>I can actually fly planes too. Managed to shoot down a helicopter and a plane last night (though the plane kill took about 5 minutes of frantic flying from my victom). Though there's always someone else behind me waiting for me to fly straight for a half second too long :(.</p>
<p>If you like team games, with a rather unrealistic, yet somehow realistic feel, get this when it comes out on the 28th (South African release aparrently).</p>
