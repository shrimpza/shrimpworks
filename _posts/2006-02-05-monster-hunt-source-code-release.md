Well, in the interests of Monster Hunt surviving a bit longer, I'm
releasing the full UnrealScript source code.

Included is a basic license document, outlining in simple terms what you
may and may not do. Basically, you may make any kind of MH mod or
'sub-mod', however you must give due credit for the original creation.
Even if it's very basic, please read it if you intend using it for
creating a mod.

You'll find the file at the end of this post... Have fun :)
