<p>Yes indeed, I am posting a recipe now.</p>
<p>This recipe is a combination of a few, and some customisation.</p>
<p><b>Cheese Sauce - Ingredients:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>2 Tbsp margarine</li>
<li>2.5 Tbsp flour</li>
<li>1 cup cream</li>
<li>1 cup milk</li>
<li>1 cup grated mature cheddar cheese</li>
<li>1 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cheese Sauce - Method:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Melt the margarine in a saucepan until it starts to bubble gently</li>
<li>Slowly mix in the flour, ensuring it's thoroughly smooth</li>
<li>Very slowly, bit-by-bit, mix in the cream and milk, keeping the mixture as smooth as possible</li>
<li>Once all the milk is in, you should now have a smooth creamy white sauce. Mix the the cheese and stir until melted</li>
<li>At this point, you may optionally stir in the cayenne pepper, or other spices of your preference</li>
</ol>
<p>The same cheese sauce can be used for making macaroni and cheese :).</p>
<p><b>Potato Bake - Ingredients:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>5-6 medium-sized potatoes</li>
<li>0.5 cup onion, sliced</li>
<li>0.5 cup grated cheese</li>
<li>Freshly ground salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potato Bake - Method:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-heat oven to 180 degrees Celsius</li>
<li>Wash and slice potatoes (peeling optional - I did not peel them) into 0.5-1cm thick slices, and cover the bottom of a casserole dish with one layer</li>
<li>Place a third of the onion slices on top of the potato slices and add salt and pepper</li>
<li>Pour out a third of the cheese sauce over the onions and potato</li>
<li>Repeat layering an additional 2 times, and top with grated cheese over the final layer of cheese sauce</li>
<li>Place in the oven and bake for 1 hour</li>
</ol>
<p>DONE. Now stuff your face!</p>
