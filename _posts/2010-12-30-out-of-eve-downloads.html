<p>This is just a small update on the status of OOE. As the SVN server previously hosting the OOE source died, and many people have been looking for the source, a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ooe/">Google Code project has been started</a> to facilitate future development.</p>
<p>The source is available as both a regular download and via Subversion.</p>
<p>It's unlikely I will be doing any development on the project myself, however contributors are welcome.</p>
