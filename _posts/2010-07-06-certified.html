<p>I got my Sun Java Certification yesterday :-).</p>
<p>Apparently after writing multiple fairly large business-critical Java applications and services for the past few years, this certification means I now know how to write Java code so I should be able to make some fairly large business-critical applications and services. Yay!</p>
