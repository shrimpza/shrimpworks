<p>Heh, I'm feeling sort of blank lately... :(</p>
<p>Finally my Naruto collection is up-to-date thanks to |sAvAgE|, and he's filling in the missing parts of the Full Metal Alchemist series too. So I've started watching FMA from the beginning again.</p>
<p>Something is REALLY wrong with the IS FTP server. I think they must be doing shaping for non-IS customers propery now :(. Updated a bunch of xan's (this server) packages last night and it took an age to download just 27mb.</p>
