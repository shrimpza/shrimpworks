<p>So I got myself a shiney new samsung D500 phone!</p>
<p> Since WP supports posting by email and this phone can send them, i thought i would mess around a bit with the concept.</p>
<p> Heres a rather bad photo taken out my office window...</p>
<p><!--Mime Type of File is image/jpg --><a href="http://shrimpworks.za.net/wp-photos/20050708-100120-1.jpg"><img src="http://shrimpworks.za.net/wp-photos/thumb.20050708-100120-1.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" class="wp-mailimage" /></a></p>
