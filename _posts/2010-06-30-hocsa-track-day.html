<p>The <a href="http://www.hondaowners.co.za/">Honda Owner's Club of South Africa</a> hosted a Bridgestone-sponsored track day at Zwartkops this last Sunday. Was seriously awesome to be able to zoot around with similar performance cars, unlike a regular track day where you have to constantly worry about being run off the road by BMW M3s :D.</p>
<p>A highlight was a pair of Integras out on the track, although I'm proud to say my 'lil Type R was quite capable of outperforming them all day :P.</p>
<p>Grabbed a bunch of shots of the action.</p>
