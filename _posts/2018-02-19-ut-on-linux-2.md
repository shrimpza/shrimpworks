After [installing and running Unreal Tournament (UT99)][part-one] using Wine,
I thought it would be good to try running a Linux-native version of the game.

Thankfully, this is reasonably easy, and seems very stable - more so than 
running under Wine.

Before you start, you'll need the original Unreal Tournament game files, most 
easily obtainable by [installing the Steam version using Wine][part-one].

## Part Two

As per the previous part, I'm using Debian Sid, so these instruction may need
some manual conversion to your distribution of choice, and you'll need to 
enable multi-arch (UT is 32-bit only).

- To begin, we'll use `game-data-packager` to build Debian packages, which also
  includes scripts to download and apply the latest patch. 
  [Game Data Packager][game-data-packager] is really super cool, and can build
  `deb` packages for loads of games. It's worked pretty well for me getting
  Freespace 2 running as well for example. Install it now:

  ```bash
  $ sudo aptitude install game-data-packager game-data-packager-runtime 
  ```
- Now, we'll build the shared data (maps, textures, music, etc) and the actual
  executable binary packages. Pass the path to your UT install (here, I'm
  passing it the path to the Steam install I did in Part One):

  ```bash
  $ game-data-packager ut99 --everything ~/.wine/ut/drive_c/Steam/steamapps/common/Unreal\ Torunament/ --binary-executables
  ```
- Once this is done, you'll have three packages you can install, and they can 
  be installed using `dpkg`:

  ```bash
  $ sudo dpkg -i unreal-ut99-shared-data_200+58_all.deb
  $ sudo dpkg -i ut99_451+58_i386.deb
  $ sudo dpkg -i ut99-data_451+58_all.deb
  ```
- The game depends on SDL 1.2, and will also a require 32-bit PulseAudio OSS 
  pre-load library for sound to work:
  ```bash
  $ sudo aptitude install libsdl1.2debian:i386 libpulsedsp:i386
  ```
- As of this writing, there's a long-outstanding 
  [bug with the `padsp` script][padsp-bug] which can't launch 32-bit 
  applications. The the bug report includes a suggested fix:

  ```bash
  $ sudo cp /usr/bin/padsp /usr/bin/padsp32
  $ sudo sed -i 's/\/x86_64-linux-gnu\/pulseaudio\//\/i386-linux-gnu\/pulseaudio\//g' /usr/bin/padsp32
  ```
  This provides a new 32-bit capable `padsp32` pre-loader command, which we'll
  use to launch the game.  
- Now, you'll need to attempt running the game. Don't worry if it fails or 
  likely doesn't have sound at the moment. This step is primarily to seed the
  `~/.loki/ut` directory, where the local game files will be placed, which 
  we'll modify shortly. Launch with the `padsp32` command as follows:
  
  ```bash
  $ padsp32 ut99
  ```
  Quit the game if it worked, and look at the contents of `~/.loki/ut` - you
  should now see a familiar-looking `System` directory layout and contents.
- Now, lets get a newer OpenGL renderer, with better support for things like 
  decals and detail textures, hugely improving the graphics of the game. 
  Download the UTGLR renderer from [letsplayut.com][lets-play-ut] 
  ([mirror download][OpenGLDrv.so]) and place it in `~/.loki/ut/System`. You'll
  need to remove the current symlink first:
  ```bash
  $ unlink ~/.loki/ut/System/OpenGLDrv.so
  ```
- Modify `~/.loki/ut/System/UnrealTournament.ini` to make use of this renderer,
  and while we're here, change the audio device:
	```properties
  [Engine.Engine]
  GameRenderDevice=OpenGLDrv.OpenGLRenderDevice
  RenderDevice=OpenGLDrv.OpenGLRenderDevice
  AudioDevice=Audio.GenericAudioSubsystem
  ```
- Now, run the game again with `padsp32 ut99`, hopefully there's sound, and a
  better looking game!
- Refer to the [UTGLR Settings][utglr-settings] page for information about 
  other rendering options you might tweak, and also refer to 
  [part one][part-one] for setting the frame rate and limit if desired.

That's it. You should _hopefully_ have a fully Linux-native working Unreal 
Tournament installation. It's also fully compatible with all multiplayer 
servers I tried. 

You can also install mods and maps by installing them under the `~/.loki/ut`
directory - just create `Maps`, `Textures`, `Music` directories under there, 
and extract maps and mods to the appropriate places, and they'll show up 
in-game.

I'd like to perhaps investigate writing some simple scripts to manage 
installing maps and things into the appropriate places, to make life easier
and UT on Linux even more appealing.

For some additional info in case you have any other issues, check some of the
points on the [PC Gaming Wiki][pcgaming-wiki].
