<p>Well because I'm aparrently not doing any work here... I'm being trekked off to JHB yet again. No idea when I'm even getting back. Lovely 3 days notice I'm given too.</p>
<p>Seems whenever things in my life start settling down and I actually start getting things done, this shit pops up...</p>
<p>Hrm, I just remembered I was supposed to do some work for an old client this weekend too... LOLOLOL...... :-(</p>
