<p>I wanted to add a unit conversion plugin to <a href="https://github.com/shrimpza/zomb">ZOMB</a> and would really have liked to use an off-the-shelf existing API, but because this didn't seem to exist in a nice hosted format already - I had to make it :).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shrimpza.github.io/units-api">Units API</a> is written in PHP, and is intended to provide an extremely simple and easy-to-use HTTP API for the conversion between various units of measure. Usage documentation is available on the project's Github page.</p>
<p>I'm also hosting a publicly usable version, at the following URL, so hopefully next time someone needs this they don't need to reinvent the wheel (again, refer to documentation linked above for usage): </p>
<p> - <a href="http://tools.shrimpworks.za.net/units-api/convert.php">http://tools.shrimpworks.za.net/units-api/convert.php</a></p>
<p>As an aside, this project served as my first introduction to <a href="http://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit </a>for PHP unit testing, and CI is once again provided by <a href="https://drone.io/github.com/shrimpza/units-api">Drone.io</a> which has performed admirably. Design-wise, it was another exercise in defining the public-facing API before a line of code was written, which served as an excellent guide and source of documentation as I worked on it (plus, there's no need to worry about writing documentation when you're done :D).</p>
