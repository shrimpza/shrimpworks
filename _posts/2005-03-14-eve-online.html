<p>Well I'm back from JHB :P.</p>
<p>I just spent my entire weekend playing EVE Online - a MMORPG type affair based in space - if you've played Microsoft's Freelancer, you'll have an idea of what this game's about. Onle difference is that EVE is a million times bigger, has thousands of players online at any given point (all in a single, living universe), is nowhere near as linear or dull, and the graphics will blow you away.</p>
<p>The best way I can think of for describing this game would be "OMG". It is absolutely massive. Over the entire weekend I trek'ed around maybe 10-15 solar systems at the most, yet there are hundreds available. Every time I arrive to dock at a station, or pass by a stargate (transport between systems) there are ships I have never seen before. There are NPC-based missions galore, there are hundreds of player-run corporations, doing mining, production, peace-keeping, bounty hunting, and who knows what else.</p>
<p>This is absolutely THE most open-ended game I've ever laid eyes on... You can do absolutely anything. For example, you could set yourself up with offices and a production facility in a station, then go out and mine for ore and stuff, bring that back, refine it, buy some blueprints for a ship, build the ship with the refined ore, and sell the ships to other players. You could even buy ore from other players who do the mining for you, or buy new blueprints from traders bringing them from systems 20 jumps away.</p>
<p>It's quite amazing... Get someone with a full subscription to give you a 14-day trial, download the client for free, and give it a bash :).</p>
