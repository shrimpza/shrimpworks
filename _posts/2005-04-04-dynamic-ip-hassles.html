<p>Dunno if anyone would have noticed but the site was blinking on and off last week, with dynamic DNS issues.</p>
<p>I've been using an application which runs as a service on my Windows machine, but it seems to often give up if it can't get a new IP or the udate fails, and sometimes it just doesn't bother even trying :-).</p>
<p>Anyway I slapped up a quick Python script to be run from a cron job at 5 minute intervals to check a website which provides my IP (like <a href="http://checkip.dyndns.org">http://checkip.dyndns.org</a>), grab the first IP it finds, and updates my ZoneEdit account with the new IP.</p>
<p>Seems to have been running reliably the past few days now.</p>
<p>I've dumped it on the Files page if anyone would like to give it a go. It's set up for ZoneEdit, but I'm sure it's easy to adapt to other services as well.</p>
