<p>*sigh* Look at me starting a million projects and never finishing any of them :P.</p>
<p>Well this one, I fully intend finishing at least. It's a wxPython GUI front-end for Dosage (http://slipgate.za.net/dosage/) which basically has the sole goal of making managing your comics easier for the mouse potatoes out there (and makes Dosage more accessable to the average Joe user who doesn't want to mess around with command lines and stuff).</p>
<p>At present, it doesn't do much, it simply builds a nice tree of comic modules (virtual modules are displayed as branches) and allows you to add those to a list (which basically makes up your 'subscriptions'), and lets you select one or more of those and have Dosage download the latest strip for them.</p>
