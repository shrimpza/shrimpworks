<p>This is a republishing, with some minor tweaks and alternatives provided, of the original recipe by <a href="http://www.easy-sugar-free-recipes.com/sugar-free-healthy-breakfast-muffins.html">Andrew Muller</a>. I could not find some of the ingredients in local shops, so had to slightly tweak things.</p>
<p>I'd also recommend against using paper muffin cups, as the first two tray-fulls of these were so stuck to them half the muffin content ends up going to waste.</p>
<p>The ingredient volumes below make about 20-30 muffins depending on how big you make them.</p>
<p><b>The Recipe</b></p>
<ul>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 tsp. vanilla</li>
<li>2 cups unsweetened apple sauce</li>
<li>1 banana, mashed</li>
<li>1/2 cup agave (alternative: ~100ml honey mixed with ~50ml hot water to achieve similar consistency)</li>
<li>5 cups rolled oats</li>
<li>1/4 cup flaxseed meal (alternative: 1/2 cup wholewheat flour)</li>
<li>1 tbsp. ground cinnamon</li>
<li>3 tsp. baking powder</li>
<li>1 tsp. salt</li>
<li>2 cups milk (almond milk for dairy free)</li>
<li>Optional toppings: raisins, walnuts, almonds, chocolate chips.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Directions</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 180 degrees celcius. Mix eggs, vanilla, apple sauce, banana & agave.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, mix oats, flax, cinnamon, baking powder and salt. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Finally, pour in milk and mix.</li>
<li>Spray a muffin pan with baking oil or use muffin liners. Pour batter evenly into each liner. If using toppings add them onto tops of muffins now.</li>
<li>Bake 35-40 min, test with toothpick if it comes out clean the muffins are done. Cool and enjoy, or freeze in freezer bags if you plan on storing them more than a few days.</li>
</ol>
