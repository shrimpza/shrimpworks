<p>Well, in the interests of Monster Hunt surviving a bit longer, I'm releasing the full UnrealScript source code.</p>
<p>Included is a basic license document, outlining in simple terms what you may and may not do. Basically, you may make any kind of MH mod or 'sub-mod', however you must give due credit for the original creation. Even if it's very basic, please read it if you intend using it for creating a mod.</p>
<p>You'll find the file at the end of this post... Have fun :)</p>
