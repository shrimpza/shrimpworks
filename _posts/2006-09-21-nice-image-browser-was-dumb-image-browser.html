<p>After the release of the "<a href="http://shrimpworks.za.net/2006/05/28/php-image-browser-and-download-stats/">Dumb Image Browser</a>", (which worked/works very well for what it's supposed to do), I thought of prettying it up a bit, and adding some extra features.</p>
<p>The result is the <a href="http://shrimpworks.za.net/projects/image-browser/">Nice Image Browser</a>. It's vastly improved in terms of visuals, as well as offering features like easier browsing around the galleries, easy creation of new galleries, and uploading files directly from the browser.</p>
<p>It maintains the same PHP5-powered, database-less, cache-less, auto-thumbnail generating system of the Dumb Image Browser, meaning it's just as easy to get set up (copy the files to a directory you want to become your gallery).</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://kaydash.za.net/">Korpse/k4y/K`</a> for the new stylesheet used for displaying the thumbnails.</p>
<p>The ReadMe includes usage and setup instructions. Happy image browsing! :)</p>
