<p>Sup.</p>
<p>Since there are <a href="http://blog.mbvdl.net/">certain people</a> about how hosting a website on unreliable home ADSL is a generally bad idea, I've decided to move it to a more stable, permanent home on my little <a href="http://linode.com/">Linode</a>.</p>
<p>Also, since my last post, a number of things have happened in my life in general. Firstly, I bought a really leet car. A brand spanking new <a href="http://xan.shrimpworks.za.net/pics/?./car">Honda Civic hatch</a>. It's probably the single most awesome thing I've ever owned, and I love it to death :D.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, mother and I decided to club in together and buy a town house. We've only ever rented places before, so the whole buying thing was a bit new, but it pretty much sorts itself out after 3459094 different companies and institutions shove 459345 different documents in front of you to sign.</p>
<p>The place is in a nice small complex in a quiet corner of Ruimsig, on the very western edges of Roodepoort. Very nice little house, nice big garden (sometimes it's very relaxing to feel real grass under bare feet :)).</p>
<p>Anyway, work's been keeping me pretty busy, so I haven't had a lot of quality time with either of the above new things... Really need to take some leave I think...</p>
