<p>*sigh*</p>
<p>Seems I've been called off to head office again at literally a day's notice. I was heading up next weekend though for a LAN with the Avatars (the UT clan I'm in), so I guess it isn't all bad. Only problem now is carting around my PC, a new LCD monitor which I'll pick up while I'm there, 2 weeks worth of clothing, and my laptop. Going to have to courier the PC up and have someone courier it and the monitor back after the LAN :(.</p>
<p>Internet is also blocked during office hours in head office, so I'm basically stuffed as I can't exactly go home and see to things in the evenings. Where I'm responsible for a bunch of projects, websites, etc online, this isn't exactly helpful at all. Hopefully I can still SSH home every now and then... Can't even use VNC since my PC's going to be all over the country.</p>
<p>Should be back by Monday the 28th... They don't even know where I'm going to be staying while I'm up there.</p>
<p>*sigh* I hate this :(.</p>
