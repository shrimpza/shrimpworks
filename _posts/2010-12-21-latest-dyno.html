<p><a href="http://shrimpworks.za.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/WRC_Dyno_20101211.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-148" title="WRC_Dyno_20101211" src="http://shrimpworks.za.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/WRC_Dyno_20101211-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="192" align="right" /></a> Attended a dyno day at <a href="http://www.wrctuning.co.za/">WRC Tuning</a> on the 5th. Was the first opportunity I've had to compare my car to other FN2s at the same time under the same conditions, and I'm rather impressed :)</p>
<p>Stock cars made between 116 and 117 kw on the wheels, and my car pulled off a very respectable 131 kw. Not bad for a naturally aspirated 2l motor in oxygen-starved Jo'burg :D.</p>
