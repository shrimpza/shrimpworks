<p>I was browsing around the <a href="http://forums.beyondunreal.com/">BeyondUnreal Forums</a> the other day, and came across an <a href="http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?t=129272">11 page thread</a>, with around 720 replies, about <a href="http://www.unreal2.co.za/mh/">Monster Hunt</a>. Interested to see what's up, I checked the <a href="http://csports.net/">CSports</a> rankings for Unreal Tournament, and was shocked to find MH is the #4 most played UT gametype in the world. Coming in after CTF, DM, and TDM.</p>
<p>Seems people have been making maps like nuts, there seem to be over 300 of them, there are a few mutators and mods available for it as well. I found there's even a pretty large fansite, <a href="http://www.planetmonsterhunt.com/">Planet Monster Hunt</a>.</p>
<p>Not too bad for a mod I thought I had retired nearly four years ago ;).</p>
