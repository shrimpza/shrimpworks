<h3>Update 14 April 2013:</h3>
<p>This project hasn't been maintained or updated since original release, it likely no longer functions. It's still here for archive and reference purposes.</p>
<hr /></p>
<blockquote><p>myTube is a simple web-based YouTube clip downloader and converter. You paste the URL to the YouTube clip you want to download, and it downloads the video using the Python-powered <a href="http://www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a>, then converts it to MPEG which can be played in your media player of choice, via ffmpeg. It then offers the converted file for download.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Easy install, just dump the scripts on your server.</li>
<li>Previously downloaded/converted clips are always browsable and available, so you don't need to do the conversion process again.</li>
<li>If a duplicate clip is downloaded, the conversion process is skiped and the already converted video is served.</li>
<li>Web 2.0 styling including fake AJAX!</li>
</ul>
