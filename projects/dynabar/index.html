<h3>Update 14 April 2013:</h3>
<p><em>This project hasn't been maintained or updated since original release. It's possible it still works out-the-box with an appropriate PHP configuration, however your mileage may vary. It's still here mostly for archive and reference purposes.</em></p>
<hr /></p>
<p>A userbar is a small image (350x19) typically used in the 'signatures' of forum (the phpBB, vBulletin, etc type) users, to show their support for software, hardware, food, pretty much anything.</p>
<p>DynaBar adds another dimension to userbars, as it generates them dynamically from plugins (a small PHP script which determines the text displayed on the userbar).</p>
<p>This allows users to show all kinds of real-time information in their userbar signature images, such as game statistics, weather, their currently playing song, random texts, etc, etc.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Userbar content is completely dynamic, and can be generated from information available in real-time.</li>
<li>All content is provided via a simple plugin system, plugins are easy to create and can return any information, and gather that information from any source.</li>
<li>Complete interactive userbar designer, allowing users to create their own userbars quickly and easily, using any available plugins, and a host of visual options. As you work, a preview is updated so you see the results of your changes instantly. Cross-browser compatible.</li>
<li>Once generated, userbars are cached (each plugin can define it's own cache timeout), saving bandwidth and server resources.</li>
<li>Userbar browser, showig all userbars created with DynaBar, and presenting simple HTML and Forum cut-and-paste code.</li>
<li>Ability for users to create animated/rotating userbar "groups". String multiple userbars into a single animated one, still maintaining it's dynamic DynaBar content.</li>
<li>No database or other advanced back-ends required.</li>
<li>Simple setup - dump the scripts onto your server, set some directory permissions, and you're ready to go. No direct server access or administrative interaction required.</li>
<li>PHP 4 and PHP 5 compatible. (individual plugins may have more specific requirements).</li>
<li>Suitable for installations on community websites, as an extra 'service' for users. Plugins are simple enough to enable webmasters to create custom content for their community/site quickly and easily.</li>
</ul>
