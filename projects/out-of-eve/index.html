Out of Eve is a PHP web application which allows you to keep complete track of your Eve Online characters and corporations, when you're not in-game. Because it's web-based, all you need is a browser and internet access to keep tabs on your market orders, transactions, assets, manufacturing jobs, training, starbases, etc.</p>
