<p>A very simple, clean PHP5-powered image gallery/browser, which doesn't require databases, thumbnail caches, detailed setup procedures, or other stuff you may be used to when dealing with web-based image galleries.</p>
<p><center><a href="http://shrimpworks.za.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/nib.png" title="Nice Image Browser"><img src="http://shrimpworks.za.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/nib.thumbnail.png" alt="Nice Image Browser" /></a></center></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>The gallery is normal folder on your web server/site, full of PNG, JPEG, and GIF images.</li>
<li>Sub-folders automatically become sub-galleries, allowing you to sort your images into logical browsing paths.</li>
<li>You can easily create new sub-galleries and upload new images at any level in your gallery.</li>
<li>Automatic, dynamic thumbnail generation, with customisable thumbnail sizes.</li>
<li>Automatic down-scaling of large images if they are too large to fit in the browser window.</li>
<li>Easy setup, just drop the files into any directory on your website for an instant gallery!</li>
</ul>
