<p>Update 14 April 2013:</p>
<h2>It died.</h2>
<p><em>Unfortunately, this project was never polished to a point I felt good about releasing. At this point the code seems to be lost. What it was, was a web interface for browsing and managing web comic strips downloaded via <a href="http://wummel.github.io/dosage/">Dosage</a>.</em></p>
