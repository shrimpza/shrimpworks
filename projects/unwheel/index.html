<p><em><strong>Forward, 15 April 2013:</strong> I have reproduced the original "About" page in it's entirety here, as well as the old screenshots from the website for future reference and archiving purposes. The <a href="http://unwheel.beyondunreal.com">original UnWheel website</a> may continue to exist for an unknown length of time, and is no longer maintained by myself.</p>
<p>A lot more information, screenshots and discussion can be found on the <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/unwheel">UnWheel ModDB page</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, a round-up of the various awards and accolades accumulated by UnWheel <a href="http://shrimpworks.za.net/2005/01/17/unwheel-moddbs-1-driving-mod-2004/" title="UnWheel – modDB’s #1 Driving mod – 2004">can be found on this page</a>.</em></p>

<h2>About UnWheel</h2>
<p>UnWheel is a driving modification for Unreal Tournament 2004 with a focus on fun driving.</p>
<p>Rather than just racing, many different vehicle-based gametypes are on offer, giving the player an assortment of different styles of play and environments in which to drive.</p>
<p>Along with this wide range of modes of play, UnWheel features every type of four-wheeled vehicle you could think of, from sports and rally cars, to monster trucks, quad-bikes and massive mining trucks.</p>
<h4>A wide range of gametypes:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Race</strong><br />
    <em>Classic lap-based racing</em></li>
<li><strong>Rally</strong><br />
    <em>A long race over a single stretch of road</em></li>
<li><strong>Capture the Flag</strong><br />
    <em>Players compete to return the flag to a central location on the map</em></li>
<li><strong>Roamer</strong><br />
    <em>'Open-ended' freestyle driving where players try to score by driving over random scoring points</em></li>
<li><strong>K-Ball</strong><br />
    <em>Get the giant beach-ball into the goal to score</em></li>
<li><strong>Rabbit</strong><br />
    <em>Players compete for possession of the flag in order to score</em></li>
<li><strong>King of the Hill</strong><br />
    <em>Dominate an area of the map for as long as possible to gain points</em></li>
<li><strong>Wrecker</strong><br />
    <em>Smash other vehicles to cause damage and eventually wreck them</em></li>
<li><strong>Team variants</strong><br />
    <em>Capture the Flag and K-Ball are available in team variants, with their own set of team-specific maps</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>Multitude of vehicles:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sports/Racing cars</strong><br />
    <em>Sleek and fast, well suited to road driving</em></li>
<li><strong>Monster Trucks</strong><br />
    <em>Giant trucks with giant wheels for giant off-road action</em></li>
<li><strong>Rally cars</strong><br />
    <em>The ideal mix of speed and great on- and off-road handling</em></li>
<li><strong>Weird and wonderful</strong><br />
    <em>A few little (and some rather large) extras to add spice to any round</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>General features:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freedom to choose any vehicle</strong><br />
    <em>At the start of each map, you are given the option to choose any of the vehicles without restriction</em></li>
<li><strong>Control options</strong><br />
    <em>You can play with your regular Onslaught controls, use mouse steering, or set up a gamepad or even steering wheel</em></li>
<li><strong>Multiple skins per vehicle</strong><br />
    <em>Most vehicles have at least three or four skin variations available, so even when many people choose the same vehicle, you can still look unique.</em></li>
<li><strong>New HUD</strong><br />
    <em>The HUD has been replaced with something a little more relavent, and shows gametype-specific information.</em></li>
<li><strong>L33t effects</strong><br />
    <em>All kinds of effects, including headlight volumes, real-time reflective vehicle bodies, surface-specific effects for grass, mud, sand, ice, water, etc.</em></li>
<li><strong>Customisable</strong><br />
    <em>UnWheel is completely customisable and flexible, meaning it's easy to create your own gametypes, cars, etc.</em></li>
</ul>
