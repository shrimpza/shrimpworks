Out of Eve is a PHP web application which allows you to keep complete
track of your Eve Online characters and corporations, when you're not
in-game. Because it's web-based, all you need is a browser and internet
access to keep tabs on your market orders, transactions, assets,
manufacturing jobs, training, starbases, etc.

[![ooe1](/assets/projects/out-of-eve/ooe1_t.png){: .image-left}](/assets/projects/out-of-eve/ooe1.png)Out
of Eve supports multiple characters across as many Eve accounts as you'd
like, supports a full range of Eve personal and corporate API data, full
item and ship reference, as well as a number of useful out-of-game
utilities.

A publicly available installation of Out of Eve is available at
[outofeve.com](http://www.outofeve.com/). The website also has a
detailed [about page](http://www.outofeve.com/about/).

The source code, issue tracker and wiki are [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/shrimpza/outofeve).

Discussion and feedback can be found on the official [Eve Online Tech
Lab Forums](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=205588).
