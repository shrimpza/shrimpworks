SaveScreen is a small Windows utility which automatically save
screenshots as JPEG images. This is especially useful for gamers, as
all screenshots can be stored in one place, there's no need to use
additional applications to re-save images as JPEGs (suitable for use
on forums, galleries, etc), and you don't need to bind different sets
of keys for every game you play, "Print screen" is all you need.

-   Select JPEG compression/quality to suit your needs.
-   **New!** Each screenshot can be saved in it's own folder, named
    after the application it's taken from.
-   **New!** Images can be uploaded to an FTP server for web publication
    and sharing, also supporting per-application sub-folders.
-   **New!** Images can be posted directly to

your images in a public DropBox folder for convenient storage and
immediate publishing!
