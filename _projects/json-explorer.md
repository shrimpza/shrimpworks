JSON Explorer is a small Windows application which allows you to easily
and visually browse [JSON](http://json.org/) structures/strings. Objects
and arrays are presented as a tree-like structure, with all their
various properties, types and values shown in a "property editor" type
view. The source string for each element within the tree structure is
also shown, neatly formatted for readability.
