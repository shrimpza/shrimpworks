A very simple, clean PHP5-powered image gallery/browser, which doesn't
require databases, thumbnail caches, detailed setup procedures, or other
stuff you may be used to when dealing with web-based image galleries.

[![Nice Image
Browser](/assets/projects/image-browser/image-browser_t.png){: .image-center}](/assets/projects/image-browser/image-browser.png "Nice Image Browser")

Features
--------

-   The gallery is normal folder on your web server/site, full of PNG,
    JPEG, and GIF images.
-   Sub-folders automatically become sub-galleries, allowing you to sort
    your images into logical browsing paths.
-   You can easily create new sub-galleries and upload new images at any
    level in your gallery.
-   Automatic, dynamic thumbnail generation, with customisable
    thumbnail sizes.
-   Automatic down-scaling of large images if they are too large to fit
    in the browser window.
-   Easy setup, just drop the files into any directory on your website
    for an instant gallery!
